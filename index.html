			<div class="text">
				I'm driving home for Christmas <br>
				Oh, I can't wait to see those faces <br>
				I'm driving home for Christmas, yea <br>
				Well I'm moving down that line <br>
				And it's been so long <br>
				But I will be there <br>
				I sing this song <br>
				To pass the time away <br>
				Driving in my car <br>
				Driving home for Christmas <br>
				It's gonna take some time <br>
				But I'll get there
			</div>
			<div class="text">
				Top to toe in tail-lights <br>
				Oh, I got red lights all around <br>
				But soon there'll be a freeway <br>
				Get my feet on holy ground <br>
				So I sing for you <br>
				Though you can't hear me <br>
				When I get through <br>
				And feel you near me <br>
				I am driving home for Christmas <br>
				Driving home for Christmas <br>
				With a thousand memories <br>

				I take look at the driver next to me <br>
				He's just the same <br>
				Just the same <br>
